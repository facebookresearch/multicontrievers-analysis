Anything that is a fusion of Mexican and American cuisines! Yumyum
Okay then, yes, I love Tex-Mex.
Oh yes, it's spread from border states such as Texas and others in the Southwestern United States all the way to Canada! 
I like cheddar cheese in my mexican food as opposed to the cheese that is actually used in authentic mexican.
Than you love Tex-Mex which is characterized by its heavy use of shredded cheese, meat (particularly beef and pork), beans, peppers and spices, in addition to flour tortillas.
I also do not eat meat, so I substitute meat for rice and extra cheese.",2

Haha i can appreciate that, i had his songs on a loop while i was gaming at 14+ years old haha. I didnt know he was an actor! What films has he been in? 
It was later in life I started liking him later in life after the Maroon 5 years.
